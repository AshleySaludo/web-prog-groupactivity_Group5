                <h4>Diplomat Hotel</h4>
                <p>Diplomat Hotel is a historic building situated atop Dominican Hill in Baguio City. It once served
                    as a rest house and a seminary way back 1911 before it was developed into a school and
                    eventually a hotel. Despite the ruins and being abandoned, the hotel remained one of the most
                    picturesque spots in the City of Pines. The place is known for being the most haunted building in the Philippines as it holds a dark history. Many people say that they see headless apparitions inside the hotel during nighttime. The employees and guests also stated that they often hear weird sounds coming from the edifice, including crying kids and babies near the fountain. Apart from that, the people living nearby claimed that they would hear the banging of doors and windows, clattering of dishes and voices of screaming people.</p>

                <h4>Fort Santiago, Intramuros</h4>
                <p>Intramuros is such a beautiful place to explore during the day as your eyes will not only feast on the ruins and Spanish architecture but you’ll also learn about Philippine history. But come nightfall, the walls of Intramuros turn into something spooky, reminding you of the dark Spanish era. If you can’t find a haunted house in Manila, get your horror fix at Fort Santiago, one of the scariest places in the Philippines. Thousands of civilians and soldiers were tortured or killed in Fort Santiago during World War II. So, it’s just safe to say that the ghosts of the fallen civilians and soldiers patrol at night, and some even say that you can hear the screams of the tortured and killed.</p>
